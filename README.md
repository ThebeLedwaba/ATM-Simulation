# ATM-Simulation
# ATM Simulation Project

This is a console-based ATM simulation program built in C++. It allows users to create accounts, log in, and perform banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and checking balances. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming, file handling, and basic encryption for passwords.

## Features
- Account creation and login system.
- File storage for user data.
- Deposit and withdrawal functionality.
- Transaction history tracking.
- Password encryption using XOR for basic security.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ ATM.cpp -o ATM
   ./ATM
